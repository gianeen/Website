<p>Ever wanted to express some gratitude to the people you went to school with for the past four years because you’re graduating in 13 days and started writing on R (because Microsoft Word is overrated) but then learned how to use Python while having a project due in 5 days and you need to show your professor how to use Python and R together? Because same. So I took all my problems and combined them into one.</p>
<p>First, I used ’ol reliable, RStudio. I figured since I’m thanking everyone, I might as well start off every messge of gratitude with “thank you for”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
ty&lt;-&quot;thank you for&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With handy-dandy Python, I began to differentiate the messages I had for each pal.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>rachel= &quot;being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me.&quot;
