```
So- you're graduating in 13 days, you want to express some gratitude to the people you've met along the way during your past four years in college, and you have a project due in 5 days which requires you to demonstrate to your professor that you understand the value in and know how to execute using Python and R together.

Have no fear! Today I'm going to show you how you can do just that. *"But Gianeen, why not just use R or Python exclusively?"* Well, person-who-is-reading-this, if you're going to code in the real world (*hello adulthood*), chances are, you will be required to use more than one language. It's just like providing healthcare services in the state of Texas- knowing Spanish and English is an advantage- just like knowing *both* R and Python is an advantage! 

Alright, enough blabbering. Let's get to it (Warning- these are really long and sentimental- but this is my last college project ever at the University of Texas at Austin, so why not go all out?) 

First, I used 'ol reliable RStudio. I figured since I'm thanking everyone, I might as well start off every message with the same start.
```{R}
library(reticulate)
ty<-"Thank you for"
```
With handy-dandy Python, I began to personalize the messages I had for each pal. 

Rachel:
```{python}
rachel= "being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me. Through this, you've always treated me with love, even if the truth hurt. Thanks for taking my temperature when we lived together when I had the flu and sorry you ended up getting sick. Ha. You know how much I love you and am eternally grateful for you. Love you, my future maid of honor!"
```

Now, I'm going to integrate R and Python together using the python function 'print()', inserting the following text within the round brackets "r.*-insert R code here-* , *-insert python code here-*": 
```{python}
print(r.ty,rachel)
```

And there you have it! A message of gratitude for your friend using Python and R! How snazzy! 

*The rest are just a repetition of above / a of couple thank-you's for my friends that they'll run into once they hop onto my site :)*

Nolo:
```{python}
nolo= "being the most levelheaded person I've ever met. You've definitely impacted my perspective on life for the better by emulating emotional agility. The way your mind works is one of the most captivating things I've ever witnessed- you're full of jokes bro. King moves only!!!! I'm so proud of you."
print(r.ty,nolo)
```

You truly know and understand me better than most people do, and I cannot thank God enough for everything we share- from singing together at Eagle's Wings to our late night car convos in front of Kins- the friendship we share is full of faith accountability, endless laughter, and more. You're going to go places farther than you can ever imagine and I just know it! Don't lose hope :)"
