<p>So- you’re graduating in 13 days, you want to express some gratitude to the people you’ve met along the way during your past four years in college, and you have a project due in 5 days and have to demonstrate to your professor that you know the power in using Python and R together.</p>
<p>Have no fear! Today I’m going to show you how you can do just that. <em>“But Gianeen, why not just use R or Python exclusively?”</em> Well, person-who-is-reading-this, if you’re going to code in the real world (<em>hello adulthood</em>), chances are, you will be required to use more than one language. It’s just like providing healthcare services in the state of Texas- knowing Spanish and English is an advantage- just like knowing <em>both</em> R and Python is an advantage in the coding world!</p>
<p>Alright, enough blabbering. Let’s get to it (Warning- these are really long and sentimental- but this is my last college project ever at the University of Texas at Austin, so why not go all out?)</p>
<p>First, I used ’ol reliable, RStudio. I figured since I’m thanking everyone, I might as well start off every messge of gratitude with “thank you for”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
ty&lt;-&quot;Thank you for&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With handy-dandy Python, I began to differentiate the messages I had for each pal.</p>
<p>Rachel:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>rachel= &quot;being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me. Through this, you&#39;ve always treated me with love, even if the truth hurt. Thanks for taking my temperature when we lived together when I had the flu and sorry you ended up getting sick. Ha. You know how much I love you and am eternally grateful for you. Love ya my future maid of honor.&quot;

<p>Nolo:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>nolo= &quot;being the most levelheaded person I&#39;ve ever met. You&#39;ve definitely impacted my perspective on life for the better by emulating emotional agility. The way your mind works is one of the most captivating things I&#39;ve ever witnessed- you&#39;re full of jokes bro. King moves only!!!! I&#39;m so proud of you.&quot;
