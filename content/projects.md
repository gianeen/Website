## Projects 

Here are some coding projects I have recently completed for my Computational Bio class at UT during my Spring 2020 semester:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Beyoncé versus Solange](/project1gbm/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification of Beyoncé and Solange's Music](/project2gbm/)
