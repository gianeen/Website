## About Me:

######  Hey there! My name is Gianeen. I'm a Chipotle connoisseur, avid R&B music listener, and a proud dog mom to two mixed Shih Tzus- Buddy (12) and Benji (7). I happily split my time in between Austin and Houston 

###### I will be graduating this May from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology, a Bachelor of Arts in Health and Society (with a concentration in Health and the Economy), and a Business of Healthcare certificate.

###### I am interested in learning about how social factors affect people's health and well-being. More specifically, I am interested in the intersection between policy and health outcomes of those who face a harder time accessing adequate healthcare, and how we can improve policy to decrease such barriers. Through my interdisciplinary education and interests, I aspire to make an impact towards improving the provision of healthcare- for **health is a human right!**

###### Right after graduation, I will be conducting research with CDF-TX, where I will be investigating health disparities across race, ethnicity, and immigration in Texas. I will also be researching test access, diagnosis, and death rates for ethnic and racial minorities amidst COVID-19 in Texas. All of these efforts will be collectively utilized to push for policy change that ensures access to health for all children in the state of Texas. How neat is that?!
