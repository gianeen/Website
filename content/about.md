######  Hey there! My name is Gianeen. I'm a Chipotle connoisseur, avid R&B music listener, and a proud dog mom to [two mixed Shih Tzus- Buddy (12) and Benji (7)](https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/83643514_3314111228605331_8040071305145352192_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=0debeb&_nc_ohc=CJFmn2Ciq00AX834ihT&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=cb20a0826255a6f549bb3b65ebe5a052&oe=5EDE0FDB). I happily split my time in between Austin and Houston (H-town hold it down)!

###### I will be graduating this May from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology, a Bachelor of Arts in Health and Society (with a concentration in Health and the Economy), and a Business of Healthcare certificate.

###### I am interested in learning about how social factors affect people's health and well-being. More specifically, I am interested in the intersection between policy and health outcomes of those who face a harder time accessing adequate healthcare, and how we can improve policy to decrease such barriers. Through my interdisciplinary education and interests, I aspire to make an impact towards improving the provision of healthcare- for **health is a human right!**

###### Right after graduation, I will be conducting research with CDF-TX, where I will be investigating health disparities across race, ethnicity, and immigration in Texas. I will also be researching test access, diagnosis, and death rates for ethnic and racial minorities amidst COVID-19 in Texas. All of these efforts will be collectively utilized to push for policy change that ensures access to health for all children in the state of Texas. How neat is that?! I am grateful beyond words to be trusted enough to contribute to CDF-TX's mission and can't wait to see where this opportunity will take me and how it will shape me as a contributor to society!

###### Anywho, this page was born because my Comp Bio professor, Nathaniel, required us to code our own website for our final project in this class. And if I'm being honest, I had a lot of fun making it.

*behind the scenes of making this website*


###### Because of this class, I have a newfound appreciation for the art of coding. This class is probably one of my favorite classes I've taken at UT! I highly recommend taking this class (SDS 348) with Nathaniel if you get the chance.

## Academic and career goals aside, I enjoy:

  - I am well-experienced in late night, *deep and existential* parked car conversations in vacant parking lots
- listening to music üé∂ (Follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/125854231?si=m_n665TSSza6lwENz2ZZoA)!) My playlists are my babies. Here are some of my favorties that I've made:

  - My [favorite R&B songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3bdPJ0U8WTgGdTIuzJBWKM?si=yIHxPl08RzivVJayFZ0dXg) as of late- I listen to this when getting ready or when I feel like dancing! 
  - A *beautiful yet chilling* compilation of [ethereal female artists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7oboSyMUAKLQg9LtsYZism?si=xe2nD9gbS-6YsHDTLBmPpg) (think Alt./Chill/Soft Indie, R&B, Pop)
  - Can't forget [male artists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/335q4KPIL1YynBJBBwmtEW?si=u20NsoTLT8a4DmNzOb9xhQ) too!
