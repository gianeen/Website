"1","Patricia, thank you for being the little sister I've never had. You *truly* know and understand me better than most people do, and I cannot thank God enough for everything we share- from singing together at Eagle's Wings to our late night car convos in front of Kins- the friendship we share is full of faith accountability, endless laughter, and more. You're going to go places farther than you can ever imagine and I just know it! Don't lose hope :)
