"1","Papa Rich, thank you for completing my senior year at UT. You have a big heart and you've always been a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. Never called someone my best friend so quickly! Looking forward to seeing how our friendship will blossom after only knowing each other for 7 MONTHS. ILY MAN.
