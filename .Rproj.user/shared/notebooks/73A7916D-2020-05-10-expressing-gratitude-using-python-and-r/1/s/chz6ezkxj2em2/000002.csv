"1","Thank you for being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me. Through this, you've always treated me with love, even if the truth hurt. Thanks for taking my temperature when we lived together when I had the flu and sorry you ended up getting sick. Ha. You know how much I love you and am eternally grateful for you. Love ya my future maid of honor.
