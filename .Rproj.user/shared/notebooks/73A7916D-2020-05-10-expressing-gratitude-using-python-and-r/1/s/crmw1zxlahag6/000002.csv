"1","Thank you for so much. So so much. I honestly don't even know where to begin. Through all our shared experiences (the lab, the UCC, past roomies) we continue to grow closer and more trusting of each other. Thank you for creating a safe space where I can be vulnerable. You are an expert at creating a welcoming and comfortable environment for anyone and everyone, including me. Your grit, resilience, and desire to always be inclusive is going to take you so far. I'm so excited to see where life takes you. Love you forever!
