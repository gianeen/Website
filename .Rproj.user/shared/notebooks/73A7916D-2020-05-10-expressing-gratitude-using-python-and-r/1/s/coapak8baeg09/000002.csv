"1","Felipe, thank you for being the best dance partner I've ever had! Seriously. I'll always cherish our ukelele jam sesh at Tyson's. You definitely know how to radiate joy and positivity in every room you walk into. You have an alluring charisma that makes people feel comfortable and safe to be themselves. Thank you for checking up on me and for always cheering me on. I can't wait to see you thrive! You got this!
