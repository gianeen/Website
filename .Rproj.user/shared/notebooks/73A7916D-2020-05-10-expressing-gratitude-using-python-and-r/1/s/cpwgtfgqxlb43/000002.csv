"1","Abel, thank you for having the most dynamic yet healthy friendship possible with me. I love how when we're together at 2AM it can either be 6th Street or the PCL. I've seen you grow so much as an individual these past 4 years and I'm so proud of how far you've come! You're truly a friend for life. Thank you for always keeping me in check and for having fun while we're at it. Can't wait to see where life takes you.
