"1","Melkon, thank you for being an amazing husband to nine children ;) I'm so glad I got to meet you. Thank you for being there for me during my most vulnerable times senior year, and for exemplifying Christ so evidently in all that you do. You've taught me more than you'll ever know and have inspired me to continue to do and be better no matter what, all in the name of optimism and trust in Him. Can't wait to see how you'll thrive throughout the rest of your time at UT and for the rest of your life :)
