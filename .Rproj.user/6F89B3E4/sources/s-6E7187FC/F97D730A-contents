        <h3>Hey there! My name is <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>. I'm a Chipotle connoisseur, R&B music listener, and a proud dog mom to two mixed Shih Tzus- Buddy (12) and Benji (7).</h3>
         <h3>I will be graduating this May from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology, a Bachelor of Arts in Health and Society (with a concentration in Health and the Economy), and a Business of Healthcare certificate.</h3>
        <h3>I am interested in learning about how social factors affect people's health and well-being. More specifically, I am interested in the intersection between policy and health outcomes of those who may face a harder time accessing adequate healthcare. Through my interests, I hope to make an impact towards improving the provision of healthcare, whether its from a local or even national level- for <strong>health is a human right!</strong></h3>
        <h3>I will be taking time off before post-undergraduate schooling to dive into my interests! Right after graduation, I will be conducting research with CDF-TX, where I will be investigating health disparities across race, ethnicity, and immigration in Texas. I will also be researching test access, diagnosis, and death rates for ethnic and racial minorities amidst COVID-19. All of these efforts will be collectively utilized to push for policy change that ensures access to health for all children in the state of Texas. How neat is that! </h3>
