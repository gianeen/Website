Here are my coding projects that I completed for Computational Biology class at UT during my Spring 2020 semester: 

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Beyoncé versus Solange](/project1gbm/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification of Beyoncé and Solange's Music](/project2gbm/)


**BIG** thank you to Nathaniel for taking time outside of lecture to help me learn how to use Spotify's API! Because of him and the opportunity to learn more about my interests in this class *through the art of coding*, my curiosity on how Spotify works has been fulfilled and I know so much more about Spotify's algorithm behind-the-scenes for its users. It's pretty neat! Check out all that you can do with Spotify's API [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/), starting under **Fields Reference**.
