## Projects

Here are my coding projects from that I completed for Computational Bio class at UT during my Spring 2020 semester: 

- [Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Beyoncé versus Solange](/project1gbm/)

- [Modeling, Testing, and Classification of Beyoncé and Solange's Music](/project2gbm/)

**BIG** thank you to my professor, Nathaniel Woodward (PLEASE TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE) for helping me learn how to use Spotify's API! I know so much more about the music I stream and how Spotify works because of him. If you ever have the chance to take this class, PLEASE DO (SDS 348- Computational Biology). I have a newfound appreciation for coding and statistics because of this class!
