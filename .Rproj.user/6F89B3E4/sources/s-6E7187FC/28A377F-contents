        <h3>Hey there! My name is <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>. I'm a Chipotle connoisseur, R&B music listener, and a proud dog mom to two mixed Shih Tzus- Buddy (12) and Benji (7).</h3>
         <h3>I will be graduating this May from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology, a Bachelor of Arts in Health and Society (with a concentration in Health and the Economy), and a Business of Healthcare certificate.</h3>
        <h3>I am interested in learning about how social factors affect people's health and well-being. More specifically, I am interested in the intersectionality between policy and health outcomes of those in the United States who may face a harder time accessing adequate healthcare.</h3>
