Ever wanted to express some gratitude to the people you went to school with for the past four years because you're graduating in 13 days and started writing on R (because Microsoft Word is overrated) but then learned how to use Python while having a project due in 5 days and you need to show your professor how to use Python and R together? Because same. So I took all my problems and combined them into one.

#refresh

git add .

git commit -m "any message, but you must have a message"

git push origin master

###### Right after graduation, I will be conducting research with CDF-TX, where I will be investigating health disparities across race, ethnicity, and immigration in Texas. I will also be researching test access, diagnosis, and death rates for ethnic and racial minorities amidst COVID-19 in Texas. All of these efforts will be collectively utilized to push for policy change that ensures access to health for all children in the state of Texas. How neat is that?! I am grateful beyond words to be trusted enough to contribute to CDF-TX's mission and can't wait to see where this opportunity will take me and how it will shape me as a contributor to society!
