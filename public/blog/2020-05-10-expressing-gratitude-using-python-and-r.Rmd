Ever wanted to express some gratitude to the people you went to school with for the past four years because you're graduating in 13 days and started writing on R (because Microsoft Word is overrated) but then learned how to use Python while having a project due in 5 days and you need to show your professor how to use Python and R together? Because same. So I took all my problems and combined them into one. 

First, I used 'ol reliable, RStudio. I figured since I'm thanking everyone, I might as well start off every messge of gratitude with "thank you for". 
```{R}
library(reticulate)
ty<-"thank you for"
```
With handy-dandy Python, I began to differentiate the messages I had for each pal. 
```{python}
rachel= "being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me. Through this, you've always treated me with love, even if the truth hurt. Thanks for taking my temperature when we lived together when I had the flu and sorry you ended up getting sick. Ha. You know how much I love you and am eternally grateful for you. Love ya my future maid of honor."
print('Rachel,',r.ty,rachel)
```

```{python}
nolo= "being the most levelheaded person I've ever met. You've definitely impacted my perspective on life for the better by emulating emotional agility. The way your mind works is one of the most captivating things I've ever witnessed- you're full of jokes bro. King moves only!!!! I'm so proud of you."
print('Nolo,',r.ty,nolo)
```

```{python}
richard= "completing my senior year at UT. You have a big heart and you've always been a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. Never called someone my best friend so quickly! Looking forward to seeing how our friendship will blossom after only knowing each other for 7 MONTHS. ILY MAN."
print('Papa Rich,',r.ty,richard)
```

```{python}
patricia= "being the little sister I've never had. You *truly* know and understand me better than most people do, and I cannot thank God enough for everything we share- from singing together at Eagle's Wings to our late night car convos in front of Kins- the friendship we share is full of faith accountability, endless laughter, and more. You're going to go places farther than you can ever imagine and I just know it! Don't lose hope :)"
print('Patricia,',r.ty,patricia)
```

```{python}
abel= "having the most dynamic yet healthy friendship possible with me. I love how when we're together at 2AM it can either be 6th Street or the PCL. I've seen you grow so much as an individual these past 4 years and I'm so proud of how far you've come! You're truly a friend for life. Thank you for always keeping me in check and for having fun while we're at it. Can't wait to see where life takes you."
