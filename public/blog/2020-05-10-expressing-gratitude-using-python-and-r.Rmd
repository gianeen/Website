Ever wanted to express some gratitude to the people you went to school with for the past four years because you're graduating in 13 days and started writing on R (because Microsoft Word is overrated) but then learned how to use Python while having a project due in 5 days and you need to show your professor how to use Python and R together? Because same. So I took all my problems and combined them into one. 

First, I used 'ol reliable, RStudio. I figured since I'm thanking everyone, I might as well start off every messge of gratitude with "thank you for". 
```{R}
library(reticulate)
ty<-"thank you for"
```
With handy-dandy Python, I began to differentiate the messages I had for each pal. 
```{python}
rachel= "being my best friend and for always wanting what is best for me."
print('Rachel,',r.ty,rachel)
```

```{python}
nolo= "being the most levelheaded person I've ever met. You've definitely impacted my perspective on life for the better by emulating emotional agility. King moves only."
print('Nolo,',r.ty,nolo)
richard= "being my go-to."
print('Papa Rich,',r.ty,richard)
patricia= "being my go-to."
print('Patricia,',r.ty,patricia)
abel= "eooow."
print('Abel,',r.ty,abel)
kenneth= "running at 6:30 am with me over Lady Bird Lake followed by harmonizing on the ukelele together for free Tyson's tacos."
print('Kenneth,',r.ty,kenneth)
francine="showing me that you can be soft and strong and loving all in one."
print('Francine,',r.ty,francine)
danny= "being so chill and for lighting up my day with your science pun t-shirts that Francine wishes you wore less."
print('Danny,',r.ty,danny)
felipe= "being you."
print('Felipe,',r.ty,felipe)
melkon= "being an amazing husband to our children!"
print('Melkon,',r.ty,melkon)
kamea= "teaching me so much."
print('Kamea,',r.ty,kamea)
phoebe= "ugh where do I start."
print('Phoebe,',r.ty,phoebe)
zoe= "being the best roommate a girl could ever ask for. I'll always cherish our conversations in the living room. I LOVE YOU!"
print('Zoe,',r.ty,zoe)
frjimmy= "being the best priest out there. I'm so sad I never got to wear the apron I made of you, but life." 
print('Fr. Jimmy,',r.ty,frjimmy)
```
