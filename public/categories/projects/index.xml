      <description>Projects Here are my coding projects that I completed for Computational Biology class at UT during my Spring 2020 semester:
  Exploratory Data Analysis with Tidyverse Tools: Beyoncé versus Solange
  Modeling, Testing, and Classification of Beyoncé and Solange&amp;rsquo;s Music
  BIG thank you to Nathaniel for taking time outside of lecture to help me learn how to use Spotify&amp;rsquo;s API! Because of him and the opportunity to learn more about my interests in this class through the art of coding, my curiosity on how Spotify works has been fulfilled and I know so much more about Spotify&amp;rsquo;s algorithm behind-the-scenes for its users.</description>
